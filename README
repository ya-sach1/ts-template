To use this template you need to install globally the following packages:

-   Jest
-   Typescript

Note to self: you need Typescript in local dependencies too for Jest to work correctly.
Note to self n.2: if you install Jest globally and not locally, ts-jest'll complain that Jest isn't installed but it works just fine. I still have it locally cause of CI.
